# Minimal project for creating custom slots

If you download this as Source Code, you'd need to compile it in Visual Studio. **INSTEAD** you can download already compiled project that doesn't need any requirements other than UE4 itself from *Releases* section.

**Fully compatible with DBD 6.5.2 (Private Server)**

## What it is for

This project contains everything you need for using all possibilities of custom slots modding. This includes:
- **Material replacement maps**. You don't need to duplicate one skeletal mesh if you only want to change used material instances. ![CustomizationItemDB](https://i.imgur.com/VJvJG95.png)
- **Socket attachments**. You can attach another meshes to your main Item Mesh by socket name (for example, attach hair to head mesh). It can be in a form of skeletal mesh or Accessory blueprint, which can be useful for creating physics.
